# CodeCademy: Data Science Foundations Project

## Exploring Mushrooms 

## Goal 
The goal of the this project was to demonstrate my skills in visualizing categorical data.  There are a couple ways to do this. One is through a bar chart and another is through a
pie chart. Using the python libraies seaborn and matplotlib we are able to visualize the different columns of data pertaining to Mushrooms.  Through the python libraries you are 
able to clean up your visualizations by adding a title, providing spacing for data labels and organizing the chart in order from greatest to least.  The part I struggled with was 
writing a conditional statement to visualize data with 6 or less columns into pie charts for easier viewing.
